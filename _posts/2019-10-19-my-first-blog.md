There're many alternatives to jekyll. For example, I tried [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), 
but finally found jekyll is more convenient since you can leave static pages to jekyll running on GitHub's server. Therefore, you can even write blog in pure web without updating messy generated static pages again and again when  any little change happen.

The most influence factor is that I found this [wiseodd's blog](https://wiseodd.github.io), I enjoy the article [Natural-gradient](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2018/03/14/natural-gradient/), especially its support to MathJax( while it seems not work on mobile browser! However you can switch to desktop mode in every mobile browser today.)
