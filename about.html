My name is Zhuo Yueyi and nickname is yiyuezhuo in many platforms.
I'm a postgraduate in Nanjing Science and Technology University(NUST),
majoring Pattern Recognition. I would like to use my 
Bayesian statistical knowledge to develope wargame, historical strategy
and policy simulation game. I believe that uncertainty is 
a forgotten valuable part of those games, which can be implemented by 
modern bayesian inference technology evolving in last few years.

My political position is between a anarchist and a libertarian while 
I don't involve policy affair much, as you know, in such a country.

As a half-weeboo, I must show my waifu to you:
